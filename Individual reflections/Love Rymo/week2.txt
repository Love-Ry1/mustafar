- What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have decided to develop an android application so I want to learn how to use the tools that we are going to use for that. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think i can help the team with some programming and git knowledge.

- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
We still have not really used much of the SCRUM methods. We have started to discuss some of the project requirements and possible user-stories, which I helped with. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I contributed by helping with planning the project, doing a business model and app mockup. I also helped with creating a short PowerPoint presentation about our project.
I participated in some team-meetings we had where we planned for the future of the project and the future sprints.
