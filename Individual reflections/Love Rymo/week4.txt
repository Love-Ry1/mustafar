- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I now have some knowledge in android studio and how to use the different APIÂ´s. For the next sprint I want to learn how to do more complicated things with the google maps
API and use it to create a better application.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If anyone has question I can try to answer them. If we encounter problems I can try to help with discussing and researching to find solutions. I can also share
useful information that I find with the rest of the team.

- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
My contribution was active participation in team-meetings and working with the agile workflow. This week we divided the group in two smaller teams to work on different
user-stories. I have also helped with planning, documentation and reflections. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
In the software I helped with using the Gothenburg parking API to recieve relevant parking-spot information and displaying it on a map (using google maps API) in the application.
