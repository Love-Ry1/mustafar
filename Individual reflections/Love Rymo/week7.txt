- What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to best present and report on our project. We still have some problems with developing in Android Studio where some feutures only work on one emulator, so I want
to learn how to solve these issues.

By listening to my team-mates and see if I have some knowledge that they dont, then I can share it.

- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
By helping with creating good user-stories that fills all the criterias. By being active in team-meetings.

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I have mostly together with my workgroup worked on solving clustering on the map, so when the user zooms out on the map the parking slots groups together.
I have also worked on a presenation the group had this wednesday.
