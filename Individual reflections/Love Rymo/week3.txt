- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to get better at using Android studio and learn how to develop a good app. Now when the "real" sprints have begun I hope to get better to work with the Scrum mindset. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help by listening and discussing with my team-members.

- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
I have contributed towards the use of Scrum by being active in the team-meetings, helping with user-stories, helping with reflections and planning the next sprint. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I have contributed by discussing the project with the other team-members, helping with the delieveres, and doing the things the Scrum-master assigned me.
