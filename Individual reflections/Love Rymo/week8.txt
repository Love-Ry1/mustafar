- What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since this is the last sprint and most of the project is done, I want to reflect and learn how we theoretically could expand the project if we had more time.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This is the last sprint where most of the project is done, so I can mostly help others with reflecting on how the project went.

- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Since we did not develop much more in the app this week, we mostly used Scrum as an aid in our meetings and presentation.

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I helped with writing the final report, fixing small things in the project/code and helping with creating and presenting a demo of our application.
