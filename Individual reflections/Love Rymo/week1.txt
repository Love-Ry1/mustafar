- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get more familiar with how agile workflow and SCRUM works and what all the necessary terminology means. I also want to learn how to use all these new work methods to our advantage for the project.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If someone has a question, I can try to answer it or help to lookup the answer.

- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
So far we have not really used many SCRUM methods, but I have contributed by participating and being active in the team meetings.

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I created a GitHub repository for the team and helped with writing and discussing the social contract.
