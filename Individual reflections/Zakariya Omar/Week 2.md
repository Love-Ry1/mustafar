What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
What do I want to learn or understand better?
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

While we havn't used Scrum much so far, my contribution to Scrum has been active
partcipation. But plan on being even more active in the future.

My contribution so far has been participating on brainstormings and helping
to settle on a project idea. And even help look up the tools we might use
and what's available to help us in our goal.

Now that we've settled on a project, I wish to learn more 
about the tools we'll be using. And as such help increase both
my individual and the whole groups performance and effectiveness
once the sprint starts.
