I want to learn some of the terminology used so far and familiarize myself with the scrum methodology. 
I aslo want to learn more about the tools that will be useful for our project, both for the coordination 
of the team and the software development in itself. And by learning more myself I'll be able to better
serve and help the team. 

My contribution to the team is that I serve in my specific role and actively 
participate. By completing the task assigned to me and adhering to our agreed upon principles and methodology
I serve as an asset to the team rather than a liability or the bottle-neck.
