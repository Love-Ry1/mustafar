- **What do I want to learn or understand better?**  
At the end of the course now I feel like I've learned alot,  
yet I wish to continue learning more outside the course.  
Having had an experience in a smaller scope I now find myself  
curious about more expansive and actual work life applications of  
what I've learned so far


- **How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**  
Now that we're left with finishing up our report I can help by sharing any bits  
of useful knowledge I might hold that I've yet to share. And whatever finding of my  
own that'll come in handy in writing the report.


- **What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?**  
Active participation and communication with my team. And by adhering to the social contract.  


- **What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?**  
Helping to preparing the presentation video and starting on the report.
