What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

What do I want to learn or understand better?

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

My contribution towards the use of Scrum has been active partcipation in the sprint planning and 
on meetings during the sprint. And my overall contribution towards the team's deliveries has been
completing my user story and doing completing the neccesary preparations for the next sprint and
the user storys I might have to complete.

My goal remains to continue familiarize myself with the Scrum methodology and practices.
And continue to dive deeper in the field of Android Application development. Which I hope
will continue to give me insight for good practices and tools that'll benefit both me and 
the enitre team in completing the project, and if possible open the door for any improvments.
