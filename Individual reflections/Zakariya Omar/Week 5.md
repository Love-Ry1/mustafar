- **What do I want to learn or understand better?**  
Now that we're nearing the end of our project I wish to spend  
some time learning how to launch our app. Which includes making  
an app icon and any setup and configurations needed to publish our  
app.


- **How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**  
By sharing and explaining my findings. And by taking the time to help somoene else  
when I've the knowledge to do so.


- **What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?**  
Active participation and communication with my team. And by adhering to the social contract.  


- **What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?**  
Been working on the user interface and fine tuning what will be the final version.  
Completed my user stories and head into the next sprint ready to take on some new.
