-What do i want to learn or understand better?  
My answer to this question is that i would like to research a bit more about the agile methods and how to use them efficently  
in a team to drive the project forward. We have not started our first sprint yet which is planned to start on monday but until then i will read up on these areas to
increase my value to the team.  

-How can i help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?  
The team has not yet begun with the devlopment of the app. We have decided to create an
Android application. Since i have read up on a lot of the requirements for the sprints and what is to be expected of us i believe that i can help with planning out the
sprints and organizing them so that we know what should be done at what sprint. And also who does what and so on. In this way i believe i can share my knowledge about
teamwork and organization to the team so that we all can take part in it.

-What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?  
As we haven't started using scrum yet it is still hard to answer this question. However i have read a lot about
the scrum methods and how scrum is used so i believe that i can help with making sure that we are doing things in the ways of scrum. Like having sprint plannings,
daily scrum meeting, revieweing our sprints and so on. 

-What is my contribtuion towards the team's deliveries?  
This week we have planned our project and also done a project score in the form of a buisness model and mockup.
I have been participating with these by discussing with my team members and also myself writing out all information on the buisness model with the help of my comrades.
In the mockup i was also active by proposing ideas on what main functionalites we want to have on our application which gave everyone ideas. Then I also initiated the
discussion about planning our sprints for future weeks.
