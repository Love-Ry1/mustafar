-What do I want to learn or underestand better? Well this week has gone really well, i feel like the workflow during the sprints have become much better compared to the  
previous sprints. I am also getting a better understanding of the agile workflow and the reasoning behind this. One thing that I would like to understand better is to  
apply the DoD when I am working with a user storie. I have not really used the DoD efficently at all but always had them in the back of my mind, I hope to change this  
for the upcoming sprint.

-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? I think i can help by always making myself available for questions and code reviews if someone  
in the team needs help. I can also help by doing my part of finishing tasks in an apporipriate time so that the team is not stressed due to my actions. 

-What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum? My contribution is mostly about taking charge of the documentation made for the sprint meetings and also  
working within the agile workflow when doing my tasks.

-What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? My contribution was in working with user story number 1 and also 2 since i was active in making the visualization  
of the map possible and also helped with getting API information from our sources. I am also active in making sure ethat we follow our agile principles so that we don't  
go off track too much.
