-What do I want to learn or understand better? 

As we are approaching the end of the course I would like to deticate this last sprint to really master the agile approach in the course. I believe that I have almost achieved this by following the course and now I really want to dive deep into the agile approach. To learn the pros and cons about it and how it really is applicable to the real world and how it would be used on much bigger projects than this one. 

-How can I help someone else or the entire team to learn something new?  

I would like to help people in the team with their user stories and also helping them defining their user stories with the correct acceptance criterias. I believe that I can still help my team in being better at this task. 

-What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?  

Defining good user stories with relevant acceptance criterias and making sure that our user stories become completed and maintain a good standard. Also I try to remind everyone to always refer back to the definitions of done when completeing a user story and also to refer back to the criterias in the social contract. I have also taken 
the role of asking everyone about their effort estimation when taking on new tasks. 

-What is my contribution towards the team's delivirables?  

I have this week worked in creating some java documentation and commenting the code. Together with Love,Mirco and Abbas I have also been able to create a clustering functionality for the parking icons when zooming out on the map. This is to tidy the application up and make it more pleasant to use. Then I have also begun working with the final team report that is due soon and I have begun planning it out.
