What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to understand Github more and its functionalities since i have only worked once before in this enviorment. I also want to learn more about the agile workflow and how scrum is used in this enviroment when we start using the scrum methods. Then I would also like to revise some java since this is the programming language that we are going to use.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can help with making sure that everyone understands everything before we move on to something new. If i for instance realise that someone is not as active i will do my best to make them feel included in the discussion. I will also help with suggesting projects and ideas for what kind of project that we are going to build since we have not decided this yet. 

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum? 

We have not begun using scrum and its methods this week because we have not yet chosen a project idea. This question will be answered in the coming weeks!

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

I believe that everyone in the team has helped and tried to contribute equally this week. I was involved in writing the social contract and also in discussing and planning the meeting with the team.
