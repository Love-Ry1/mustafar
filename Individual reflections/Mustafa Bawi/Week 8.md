What do I want to learn or understand better? For my last individual reflection I want to think about what to do with the knowledge that i've gained in the course, for  
future. Firstly I would like to apply the agile software approach to bigger and longer projects that may stretch several months too really see the real benefits of working
in an agile approach. Although I feel like I have learned the most important aspects of this course and a lot of practical knowledge that I will definetly use in the future.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? As we are in the end of the course I feel like I could help my teamembers with reflecting upon the 
work that we have done. Mostly so that everyone can get agile practice knowledges with them after we finish this course. I would do this while writing the final project report
with them and also having some discussions so that everyone really takes the important aspects of this course with them in to the future.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum? Although I have learned and gained experience in creating good user stories and working in the agile manner. I 
feel like I would like to try out as a scrum master next time I do a project simiilar to this. Since I contributed sort of like a co-scrummaster when our real scrum master
wasn't available or was busy with something else. I contributed in this manneer so that the structure and flow of the project would still continue. 

What is my contribution towards the team's deliverables? This week we have a final group presentation and most of us had exams to study for the upcoming exam week. We didn't
really create any new user stories this week but we just had a goal to tidy up the code a bit and add some documentation where we felt was needed. I have worked with the
final project report together with my team this week and I have also structured the github repostitory to get it ready for the final submission!


Thank you for a great course!
