-What do I want to learn or understand better?  I would like to understand how the workflow of the agile process really works in more details. Right now
many things still feel messy and new for me. Even though our user stories for this week was to get familiarized with enviroment and create something easy it's still a new way of thinking  
when creating a project. I am still not familiar with this but I hope that I will learn it until next week!

-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?  I think I can help by encouraging active communication between all team members so that we keep
working in a team all the way through the project.

-What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum? I participated in the sprint planning phase and also updated the team whenever I am working or when I need help
with something.

-What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? Not so much this week only that I did my part in trying to learn the new enviroment that we are going to use and
also being an active member by asking questions.
