-What do I want to learn or understand better? I would say that I have many of the same issues from last time but however now I am gaining more and more insigt in the agile approach after every meeting and when we are working together. But at the same time I also get more questions in my head. My problem is that when working with my
group I don't have any clear criterias when testing/revieweing our code even though we have things like our definitions of done and our social contract. These have
however worked very well for the group at large but I feel like personally i wing it must of the time and I would like to learn to "play by the book" more efficient.
How to use our documents like our DoD more efficiently.  

-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? I help my team by actively answering questions that pop up on our discord chat and also by
finding information online that I think everyone would have use of. I feel like i have done my part by providing information about github functionalites, how to use
the scrumboard more efficently and also by providing information that could help us with our user stories.

-What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?  I believe that my contribution in this topic is centered around the GitHub workflow. Mostly by learning my
team members about how to use the Scrum Board in github more efficently but also suggesting that we use things like the "Code review" feature in github. I also help
in ensuring that our product owner is the one that approves everything added to github.

-What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? This week I have worked together with Mirco,Love and Abbas in creating price tags for the parking icons and also  changing the parking icon to a more suitable icon found from the internet. I helped to deliever relevant information online on how to create many of the functionalites
needed and I also created the new parking Icon together with the others. We did not manage to complete all of our user stories this week but I will continue doing so
with my team members next sprint.
