-What do i want to understand better? 
Untill the the next time i'll be working with an agile structure i think getting a better idea of how long a given userstory will take to complete
as they seem to take slightly longer i have predicted, setting up a co-code functionality letting others write in on my code the same time as i. How to get an emulator
for android studio that does not constantly crash.
-How can i aid others in their learning?
point out missunderstandings i my self had on a given topic to alert others working with the same material to go over these points with extra care
-What is my contribution towards the teams use of scrum
Updating the rest of the group on where i am at in my work, setting up meetings, determining what should be done at which dates
-Contributions towards deliveries
Our project was basically done at this point so i've been writing on the final report aswell as preparing for the demo we held
