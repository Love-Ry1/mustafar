-What do i want to understand better? 
How to obtain street adresses from google maps.
How to design my code in order to minimize merge conflicts.
-How can i aid others in their learning?
same as last week, although i would add introducing longer pauses in my explanations openning up for a natural question flow, and if i am able to; show example code on my 
machine whilst walking through its workings.
-What is my contribution towards the teams use of scrum
After discussion with the team i nail down which user stories to include in the sprint and what can be considered done. I try to organize times for meetings and
what we can reasonably be expected to have completed untill these, aswell as what the meeting will be about (all this is ofcourse done after conversations with the team)
-Contributions towards deliveries
I found a reasonable format for our buttons and other user interaction elements in the form of RelativeLayout. I also added search functionality to our search field
that currently handles markers, although i will change this to instead handle adresses.
Scheduled meetings, and in conjuction with others decide on topics for these.
