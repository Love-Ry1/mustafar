-What do i want to understand better? 
Making clean merges that minimize disruption to previous program functionality if that functionality is something we would like to keep
-How can i aid others in their learning?
Same as previous weeks with the addition of writing down a short explanation of concepts i want to explain to others to myself first that i may then edit if the 
explanation feels insuficient; more going from a script and take questions on that rather than improvising the explanation.  
-What is my contribution towards the teams use of scrum
As before planned meetings, what times to meet what the topic of the meeting was and roughly what we might accomplish on the meeting.
-Contributions towards deliveries
Continued working on search functionality: Worked on design for the recycler that we ultimately had to scrap, worked on onClick methods for the row items. 
Tried to fix what seemed like a bug with the Geocoder api hanging on certain inputs which made it difficult to get coordinates for addresses.
