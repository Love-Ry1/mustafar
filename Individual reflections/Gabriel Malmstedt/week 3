Although i became acquainted with the android studio environment, i still don't know of all the classes and objects we are likely to use during development.
Changing mainActivity and learning to use some more textfields and button types is what i will focus on, aswell as more quickly decide on times for meetings 
incase it seems like we won't be able to coordinate everyone and then afterwards inform others of what they might have missed.

If i suspect my explanation of a concept is not good enough i will try to provide links to additional resources.

i set up a meeting which i participated in and attended another meeting earlier in the week aswell, i tried to guide our reflection
process from the criterias we were given.

This week i made a very basic android studio program that prints a sentence when you press a button and resolved a persistant issue with my emulator
