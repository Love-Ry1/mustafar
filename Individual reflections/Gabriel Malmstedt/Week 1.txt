I want to learn techniques for better coordination of larger Github projects. 
If i have something that i think the team could benefit from knowing then i will try too make sure people are following what i am saying by asking questions that give me
insight into how much of the meaning i wanted to convey reached the person and then adjust my explanation if not everything was clear.
This week contributions came mainly from commits to our social contract and discussions on what add/change in other parts.
