--What do i want to learn or understand better?
My motivation is still the same as last week, I want to learn more about the agile methods, and improve my knowledge working within a team in order to develop any software. My goal is to get better both in programming and developing of software.

--How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
For helping someone else and to learn something new, firstly we need to start with our first sprint, but this week i helped my team to develop a rought idea for the project scope and helped them as well with making mockup and business canvas. In generell i will try my best to share my knowledge with my group members in any situations.

--what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This question could be difficult to answer since we have not started using scrum yet properly but i will be in all scrum meeting and i will contribute in making and defining user stories in the next week. 

--What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution toward the team's deliveries could be my contribution in making mockup and business canvas that we did in this week. I have been actively contributing to the both business canvas and mockup by joining in the meeting which we had during this week. Furthermore, as result of my ideas and my teams, we decided to develop our project as an android application.
