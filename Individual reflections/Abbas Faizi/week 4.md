  -- What do i want to learn or understand better?
This week I feel that it went very well with both the clarification and workflow of agile sprint, the sprint which we did was more in advance than last week. We got more familiar with the environment and developments tools of Android studio.   


  -- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By being available everytime that my teammate needs help or have question; i have tried to present my help as so. I am trying to have my contribution in daily meeting, in order to I may be help for  someone in some cases.


  -- what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As usual i take a part in all team’s meeting, plus my subteam’s meeting that we got divided in two sub teams for working with use stories. I did some enforcement to the team that is in our social contract and made them to flow the rules. As the previous week, i helped my team to write tream reflection.


  -- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

My contribution toward the team's deliveries is as same as previous week that  could be my contribution in all meetings, and also making the user stories, in some cases I tried to be actively lessoning to the scrum master and PO to make them satisfied with our deliveries, which they were very satisfied with the this weeks job. More precisely I tried to help my group with getting information API “information about the parkering spot int the gutenberg”  and use them in our application.
