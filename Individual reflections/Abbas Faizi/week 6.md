What do i want to learn or understand better?


This week I believe I have improved much more in using of DoD and understanding the process and agile meeting. I in somehow got to be better in commenting the code and using java doc morley. But I do have some problem with dividing the code in different classes in Andriod Studio, which it would help for more clarity.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since there is not much time left in the course and i getting used to scrum methods, so I will try to be more available on our discord chat to answer my teammate’s wonderings and questions. Beside that i will continue to share the source and documents that i thought it will help others by putting them in discord.
