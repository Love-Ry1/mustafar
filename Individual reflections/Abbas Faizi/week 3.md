-What do i want to learn or understand better?
My main purpose is to learn more about the agile methods and understand its workflow more better, this week we did our first sprint which was not much in advance, we had to familiarize our self with the android studios environment. I tried to discover android studios platform and I did some simple programs like “hello World”, although by doing that I am not enough comfortable with the development environment.


-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week, I tried to be active in our meetings and our discussion about making user stories and helping my group member to set up android emulator och development environment. Since i didn't have so much information in this field  then in some cases i couldnt help them as much as needed. In result until next week i will work more in android studio and android emulator to be more helpful.


-what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I feel l was in a position to make the group a kind of forcement to go forward and be in progress. Beside that, I was in all group meeting which we had and helped my teammates in group reflection and making user stories. 


-What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution toward the team's deliveries could be my contribution in all meetings, and also making the user stories, in any cases I tried to be actively lessoning to the scrum master and PO to make them satisfied with our deliveries.
