What do i want to learn or understand better?

As this one is going to be my last individual refection, I want to do a general reflection over what i learned about scrum methodology and what was the goal of this course so that I can get use of this course in my future career. 


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As we are in the end of this course and our application is done, then I could just help my teammates with the documentation and writing report. As usual if there was a need of helping over understanding something in our course or project then I will try to help. 


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Because it is our last scrum meeting and the last week of this course, so I will write the report with my teammebers and checking if we implemented as the best way the scrum methodology and if we got the use of scrum for doing this application.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week we just have a presentation of our project and writing of the final report, we did the presentation and started to write the final report. As our product owner had becomes satisfied with the product then we didn't create any new userstories because of this we have started to tidy up the code and finish the final report, that in both case we are in a good phase.
