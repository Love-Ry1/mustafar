What do i want to learn or understand better?
This week which was our 3th sprint, I feel that it went ok specifically with understanding the process and agile meeting since i am getting more and more insight in the agile approach. But i do have some problems with DoD like “all code should be commented before submission” which we need to follow it more. As result i want to be better in writing java doc and commenting the code more clearly.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By being available on our discord chat and answering my teammate’s wonderings and questions. And also by share the source and documents that might help other in our chat; i could help others.


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I think that my contribution towards the team’s use of scrum is my taking part in all team’s meeting in total group and also the sub team’s meeting in daily basis. Meanwhile we have som issues with committing and updating from gethub then we are mostly working in one computer and then committing to github, we do in this way to avoid overlapping and updating’s issue.  
 
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution toward the team’s deliveries is my participating and also continuously working on the user stories that the team has apgreed to deliver during the actual sprint. So far i worked this sprint with creating price tags for the parking icons and also changing the parking icon to more suitable and relatable icon. I worked with these user stories together with my subteam  and in some how we succeed with our user stories this sprint, although we got to put one of them in backlog to continue in the next week.
