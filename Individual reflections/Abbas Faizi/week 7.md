What do i want to learn or understand better?

This sprint I did a much more improvement and that helped me evenmore to understand what actually is behind scrum methodology, as we reache at the end of this course though i will get better to understand how i can i use this methodology in my job carrier when i got to work.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I will try to be more available on our discord and chat to be able answer my teammates wonderings about our application and scrum since ther is not much more time left in the course i feel att every one in the group are getting used to scrum methodology but maybe would be some unclearity in coding and userstories which in that case i try to be the help source.


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

As usual i will continue to participate the teams and subteams meeting to contribute towasrds the team’s use of Scrum, moreover i will successive doing my task and userstories both alone and with my subteams, and in this sprint i tried to define some userstories with my group and participating in doing them done. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have this week worked in creating some java doc and commenting in some part of the code, beside this i worked with my subteam Love, Mustafa and Mirco to do our userstories. Userstory which we worked with was to create a clustering functionality for the parking icons when zooming out on the map since it makes more clear to user for using the application and finding the desire parking spot. In the end the user stories have gone very well and we got a god result.
