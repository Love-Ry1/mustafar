1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

Just make sure that our search function is fully working and bug-free by for example further improving our recycler view and filter list. The progress so far has been really good, and as I mentioned last week one of the important parts now is to find a way to combine progress from both of the two groups' code together, that's why I have also looked into it a bit and hopefully will manage to get it done on the next sprint.

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I always make sure to explain and help my team by showing the progress that has been made, this week our group worked with the search function, so when we had our meeting I would usually show the progress by running the app and physically showing what that specific function does on our application.

3. What is my contribution to the team's use of Scrum?

I have contributed by being active in the meetings and, both the small group meetings where we worked on the search function for our application, and the big group meetings where we did our team reflection and caught up with the progress of the other group. Also, I made sure to follow and use the material that's in the social contract and the definition of done when working on our assignments.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

This week our group focused mostly on the search functionality of the application, for example connecting Geocoder to the search view, improving our recycler view and filter list, etc. We have come a long way and finished some of our user stories during this sprint.
