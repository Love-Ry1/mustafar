1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

There is so much stuff that I have learned during this course, not just individual things but also how to work as a team and help each other learn and move forward with the help of the scrum methodology and using an agile workflow. Since this is the last sprint and our project is close to done. For a future project, I would just like to really master the scrum methodology so that in future projects, I can use them more effectively.

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since we have reached the end of our project, IÂ´ve tried to sum up all the work that our team has done and share it with the whole group during our meetings to make sure that the team knows how the progress was made and hopefully learn something new. 

3. What is my contribution to the team's use of Scrum?

I have contributed by being active and participating in group meetings. My contribution this week has been mostly focused on trying to finish all our user stories and cleaning up the code so it's ready for the final submission.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

This week my group focused on finishing the project and preparing the class presentation that we had on Wednesday. We also made sure to begin writing our final project report and making sure the project is ready for submission.
