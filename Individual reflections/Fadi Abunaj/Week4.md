1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
After using android studio for some time, I feel like I'm getting used to it and am able to get applications to work, the next step would be to get used to applying more advanced functions for our program, like "how to add price tags on a specific parking spot", which is one of our user stories.

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If anyone in my group is struggling to understand a certain function on our app, I will try to help them understand it. And if anyone in our group encounter a problem, I will always try my best to research and find a possible solution.

3. What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
I have contributed by being active in the meetings and helping the team with team reflection. This week we decided to divide the teams into two smaller groups, and each group worked with a specific user story. 

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
By contributing to the user stories, giving feedback in our smaller group on how we should develop our function for the code, participating in all the meetings, and being active and listening to my colleagues.
