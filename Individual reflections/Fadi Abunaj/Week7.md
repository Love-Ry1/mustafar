1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

As we are approaching the end, I've learned a lot working on this project that will be very useful in the future. I guess one of the things I would like to learn more about is to understand how to structure our project in an easy and agile-friendly way. So that later in the line if we want to improve and update it, it won't be hard to do. 

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I always make sure to explain and help my team by for example showing the progress that has been made in our meetings. For example, we had a meeting where both of the groups showed each other their progress and how they managed to get there by explaining their code and documentation. This has been really helpful and both of the small teams have learned a lot from these meetings

3. What is my contribution to the team's use of Scrum?

I have contributed by being active the in both the big and small group meetings. This time our group finished basically all of the user stories. Also as always, I made sure to follow and use the material that's in the social contract and the definition of done when working on our assignments.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

This week my group focused on finishing all of our user stories which we have succeeded in doing during this sprint. We successfully managed to have a working search bar that can display all the addresses in Gothenburg, and a recyclerview that shows suggestions of addresses in Gothenburg upon entering an address name on the search bar. Of course, since this was basically our final sprint, me and my team spent a lot of time this week to make sure everything works and that our delivery reached everyone's expectations.
