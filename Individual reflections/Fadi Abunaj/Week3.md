1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn on how to further develop the app and using the agile process to make our workflow more effective and useful

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'm starting to learn how to use the android emulator more and more by the day, so in the future, if anyone in my group is struggling with using it, I will try to help them understand it.

3. What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
I have contributed by being active in the meetings and giving my opinions on how we should develop certain things. For example, the important thing, in the beginning, is that we should start with building our base, and then we can further develop the program/app for how exactly we want it to work.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
By helping some of the team in the group get familiar with the android studio, participating in the meetings and being active, and listening to what the SCRUM master wants me to do.
