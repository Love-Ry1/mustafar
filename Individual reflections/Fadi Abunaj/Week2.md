1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn a bit more from what I wrote last week, specifically the agile methods and how to use them so we as a team can develop the software in the most effective and efficient way possible for next week. 

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We as a team now know what project we want to develop. We have yet to actually start developing the project so we have not stumbled upon any difficulties just yet, but if something challenging were to occur in the upcoming weeks, which I'm sure they will, the team knows that I'm always there to help them and they are also open to learning new stuff like how to create an android application and take advantage of APIs to develop our projects.

3. What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
As stated before we have come up with how we want to develop the project, but have not really started developing it, thereby, we have not been able to use the SCRUM methods just yet. Nonetheless, when we start with the project next week I will make sure to inform my team to always make sure to use the scrum methods.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I have contributed by helping the team write and give ideas for the planning of the project and the development of our business model. Furthermore, my contribution was trying to come up with ideas for where we wanted to develop our application, in the end, we as a team decided we wanted to develop an android application.
