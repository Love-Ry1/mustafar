1. The team intends to use the java programming language for the project. Reasoning behind this is that all group members agreed and are most comfortable with this.
Github will be used for the project and the team will use a Git Repository to contribute to the project. 

2. The team will work together in groups and will include every member in the project. If two or more people work together then they will take turns in committing the work to the Github repository.

3. The scrum master of the group will be responsible for making sure that everyone follows the social contract and are actively contributing to the project during sprints. He will also keep track of the effort estimation of each sprint and resolve conflicts that come up during the sprint. After every sprint the scrum master is responsible for holding a team meeting where questions and concerns can be brought up. 	
4. All team members are responsible for communicating problems that may come up during a sprint to the other members of the team. Everyone should inform others of when they have time to work on the project. Commenting in the code is obligatory if one group member has worked alone.  
5. The code that is committed and the application should have the necessary documentation.
6. The team members should regularly communicate with each other. 
effort estimation / planning poker will be used in order to not take on too much work and because of that to underdeliver on our commitments given before each sprint, or risk inefficiency with our time by underestimating how much work we’ll get done.  
7. Obligatory meets in order to guarantee that everyone is on the same page before each sprint and relay difficulties from the past sprint. 
8. The code should be tested before it gets committed to the github repository.
9. If changes are made to already committed code, the member that wants to change it should first discuss it with the original writer.
10. Everyone's opinion matters and should be considered. Everyone has an equal voice and valuable contribution
11. The team will work on a sprint each week. For each sprint the members of the team should be assigned with a task that should be completed within that week. If a member of the group feels like the task at hand is too hard they should let the team know.
12. The team will work in sprints and each sprint will have an estimated length of one week. The length may vary depending on how well each sprint goes in relation to the effort estimation and also dependent on how the TA’s give us feedback. 
13. Every team member is responsible for being on time for meetings and for working in the sprints when a time is agreed upon by all members.
14. The importance of deadline, each subgroup will aim to complete their task at or before deadline if a subgroup is not able to complete their task; they will still commit whatever is done before scrum meetings 
15. Comments which we use in our project should be clear and useful, and mostly explain why instead of what
