Sprint retrospective - 4

What went well in the sprint? This sprint went very well between both subteams in the group. We completed a total of 2 user stories and also 1 user story from the backlog. We had good communcation that contributed to a good workflow and also this sprint we really focused on making use of the DoD and Social contract and making sure that we finished our tasks. In this sprint both subgroups worked on 1 computer which made it easier to work on the code since we only commit and pull from one computer.

What could be improved?
We belive that our group have taken too much work during these last sprints since we have had some user stories on the backlog from previous sprints. Even though we managed to complete these we think that our effort estimation can be revaluated. We can also be better at dividing our user stories in task breakdown to make it more clear and also improve the workflow.

What we will commit to improve in the next sprint?

Besides completing all of our user stories in the backlog we will focus on commiting everything so that we have all desired properties of our application.
