Sprint retrospective - 3


What went well in the sprint
Everyone quickly got an understanding of what their tasks were and what resources they needed to accomplish them.

The address search group was able to split responsibilities quite early when it became clear that marker gathering and address filtering could be separated. The same applies for the other group working with the information about the parking slots. 

What could be improved  
We could as a team prepare better for our user stories beforehand, this is to ensure not losing time. We realized this in the beginning of the sprint as we spent a lot of time looking up “how” to do something. 
            
We could also improve the number of group meetings we have as a whole group, since we now have divided the big group into two smaller group, which had led to the smaller group having their own meetings and we haven't really been able to discuss with the group as a whole as much as we would´ve.

What we will commit to improve in the next sprint

For this next sprint we have some user stories in our backlog that we are close to completing and we will also add new user stories. To improve with the commits we will help each other in the group and improve communication to ensure that everyone gets everything done.
