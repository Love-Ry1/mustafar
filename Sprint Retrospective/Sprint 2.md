What went well in the sprint

We got a hold of a good workflow within the team when working with the user stories. Things like team cooperation and dividing the user stories into subgroups went smoothly. Communication was also something that we did well on with discord meetings almost daily and also short conversations on chat.

What could be improved

Some members have had difficulties committing and pushing their code to the github repository.
So we could make sure that everything on the technical side works for everyone because we ran into some issues when one team member committed their changes. 

What we will commit to improve in the next sprint

We could start the sprint a little bit earlier this time, even though our sprint starts on monday and ends on sunday we still took some time to fix some things before we started working on our user stories. 

We could also track our progress a bit better and see how well we are doing in terms of what we are expected to complete in the current sprint.
