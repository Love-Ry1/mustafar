-What went well in the sprint:
The group participation and communication went quite well. Everyone has made asimple program.

-What could be improved:
Familiarize ourselves with a larger number of premade objects and their methods that we may use in our project later on 

-What we will commit to improve in the next sprint:
We will aim for greater individual scope of responsibility since we assume that
making the map (and maybe some icons) will be harder than what we have done so far.
(this was not really something that came up as a topic this week)
Making sure all methods and classes are commented before each commit.
